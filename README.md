# Logic-Sim
I wanted to do a PC with PCB,MCU and stuff, but I got no money.
So I tried to do one in Minecraft redstone, but it was too slow.
Theeeeen I tried to make one with logic simulators, but they were too limited or expensive (Mainly bc they do graphics and stuff)
So, I created my own logic simulator.
If you wanna use it. Have fun.
